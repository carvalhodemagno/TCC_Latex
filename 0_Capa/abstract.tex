This work presents a remote monitoring and control system for low cost air conditioners, which
uses Internet of Things concepts. The main tool used was the ESP8266 microcontroller, which through the MQTT protocol receives and returns requests from a mobile application. A presence sensor was used to
alerting unnecessary energy consumption, electric drive devices to power the load and an energy meter was developed to inform the consumption of the air conditioner. The Network Time Protocol was used to synchronize the
microprocessor clock, this way it was possible to turn on and off the air conditioner according to the chosen time in the application. For programming the microcontroller, the C ++ programming language was used along with the Arduino software,
which contains all the functions needed to develop the system.
